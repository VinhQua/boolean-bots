## Overview

Boole Bots is a game that is not only fun, but also an aid in helping to 
understand basic Boolean logic. This game has an arena of 8x8 game tiles in
which 2-4 bots move at random speeds and trajectories. The Bots are assigned
boolean values of 0 or 1 and boolean operations - AND, OR, NOR, NOT. 

When a bot collides with another bot its boolean operation is applied to both
it and the other bots' boolean value to determine which one wins or looses, or
if the collision results in a tie. Loosing bots disappear and winning bots 
continue moving about the arena until only one remains.
